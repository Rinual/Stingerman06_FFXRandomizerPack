# Party Stat Randomizer

Here's the party stat randomizer. First thing is first, open up the VBF Browser, then navigate to your data file for FFX in your steam's game directory and open it. It should be labeled "FFX_Data.vbf".

This randomization is a little different compared to other randomizers in this pack, as you will need to grab your specific localized file. Here's a list for each language. Be sure to go into the correct folder.

| Localized Folder | Your Language |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
|new_chpc|Chinese|
|new_depc|German|
|new_frpc|French|
|new_itpc|Italian|
|new_jppc|Japanese|
|new_krpc|Korean|
|new_sppc|Spanish|
|new_uspc|English|

So using the chart above, go to the following directory in your VBF Browser.

ffx_ps2/ffx/master/new_LOCALFOLDER/battle/kernel/

Then find and extract your "ply_save.bin" to the input folder that comes with this randomizer. I recommend keeping the browser open so you don't have to navigate here again in the next few minutes.

Open up the Party Stat Randomizer and follow the instructions there.

Drag and drop the new .bin file that was created, into the same directory you extracted the original file in the VBF Browser. When it's done with the Injection process, you can close the VBF Browser and start up a new game!

## Things to Note

This only works for new games. You will have to create a brand new save(from within the game. newly made saves will not work and will avoid the base stats entirely).

This is possibly unbalanced.

If you get bad RNG on stat rolls and HP for Tidus at the beginning, then drop this in the Issues section.
