++ Version History ++

| 0.0.1.0 | - Initial Release

Features:

1. Randomizes the stat growth values of all Aeons and all 8 Party members(Seymour Guado is a temporary party member).
2. Supports user Seed input.
3. Uses the console window(don't worry, I didn't get that dirty.).

Known Issues:

1. Starting Aeon stats can be overpowered.
2. Party members starting stats are unbalanced and can have bad starting seeds.
3. Yojimbo's MP isn't being randomized*.
4. Console Window code is just messy to look at.
5. The last 2 stats, Evasion and Accuracy, for party members are not being randomized.


* - This may not be an actual issue, however it has a lot to do with the original value being 0, as this only happened with Yojimbo's MP stat.
