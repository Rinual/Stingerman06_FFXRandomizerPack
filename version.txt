Current Version 0.1.0


++ Version History ++

| 0.1.0 | - Initial Release

Features:

1. Randomizes the stat growth values of all Aeons.
2. Supports user Seed input.
3. Uses the console window(don't worry, I didn't get that dirty.).

Known Issues:

1. Starting Aeon stats can be overpowered.
2. Yojimbo's MP isn't being randomized*.
3. Console Window code is just messy to look at.


* - This may not be an actual issue, however it has a lot to do with the original value being 0, as this only happened with Yojimbo's MP stat.
