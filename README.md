# Final Fantasy X HD Randomizer Pack

This is a randomizer pack for Final Fantasy X HD. This pack randomizes files extracted from the Data VBF file that comes with the Steam release of the game. As I have no knowledge of the PS3 or PS2 versions of the game files, it's unknown if those will be able to be randomized the same.

## What You Will Need

1. VBF Browser(I used version 3.2.0.5) - This can be found on NexusMods under Final Fantasy 12's mod section.
2. A way to read .EXE files. This was made originally on a Windows computer, but can be compiled for other machines I'm sure(if not then I can look into it).
3. Backups of the files you will be randomizing(try to avoid backing up the VBF file itself since it's a massive file to begin with).

### Release has been temproarily removed!

This has been removed temporarily to get some randomizers packed in and started. When this gets started, this message will go away!


#### These randomizers are all console window, but do not require much else.

Meaning you don't have to use something like PowerShell or Command Prompt(yay!)
