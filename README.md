# AeonStatRandomizer

This is a basic randomizer for Aeon Stats.

In order to use this, you will need a VBF Browser, which you can find on NexusMods under Final Fantasy 12.

Once you have it downloaded, open it and select "Open" then navigate to your Final Fantasy X VBF data file(initally labeled FFX_Data.vbf).

In this window, you'll want to navigate to the following folder.

ffx_ps2/ffx/jppc/battle/kernel/

Then extract the 'sum_assure.bin' file to the Input folder this program comes with.

Open the randomizer and follow the instructions.

When you're finished with the randomizer, open VBF Browser(if you closed it) and follow the instructions like above, but this time, drag and drop the newly randomized file on the right side to replace the 'sum_assure.bin' file in there. After it finishes, you can then exit VBF Browser. It saves the file automatically after closing(if it takes a while, it's saving an entire 20GB file which is why). Start up the game any have fun!


Things to note!

The early Aeons will probably be overpowered starting out. As in Valefor will probably have far too decent stats. This isn't balanced just yet.

This randomizer will NOT randomize the Luck Stat. Why? Because I haven't found out where it would be stored in the files, if it's not this one. Otherwise, it's located in the exe file and there isn't anything I can do about that.

This randomizer randomizes the current file in the Input folder, and then throws the result in the Output folder.

The code isn't clean, but will be adapted to a bigger randomizer in the future. If you want to clean up the code, be my guest, but please request permission to do so first.
